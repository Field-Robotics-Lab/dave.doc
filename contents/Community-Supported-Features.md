Community supported features are distinguished from core features as follows:

* We do not test the functionality of community supported features, except to verify that they do not break officially supported components.
* Bugs and feature requests relevant to community supported features will also be addressed by community contributors.
* When possible, pull requests pertaining to community supported features should be reviewed by the original contributors. (The Dave Team will still review to ensure that the PR does not break any core features).

Our intent in including these features is to allow us to accept a greater variety of contributions and feature requests with minimal delay. Further, as resources become available, we hope we will be able to adopt some of our community supported features into the officially supported core.

Below is the current list of features contributed by community members that are available for use, but not yet officially supported by the Dave team. Bugs and feature requests relevant to community features should be referred to the contributing community member.
